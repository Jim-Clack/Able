## This is a full checkbook program, much like the one that begins with Q, but free.
- Yearly rollover
- Unlimited undo/redo
- Scheduled transactions
- Manual and auto-reconcile
- Auto-backup weekly and rolling
- Memorized payees
- Handy register layout options
- Some forecasting
- Some charting
- Numerous other features!
## What's missing?
- It doesn't log into the bank (future) so you may want to download CSVs
- It has a couple of minor bugs that you may not even notice
- It could use a lot more charts. (hint: do you code?)
## More...
- Ignore the Licensing & WsApi trees - started before I open-sourced this
- Your data is stored in JSON format for easy editing
- Source code is fairly readable and documented internally
- I'm 75 and wrote this when I was 70, so I hope it's not too old-fashioned.
## Enjoy.
