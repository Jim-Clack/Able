SQA...
 * Intermix reconcile/year-end/checkoff/uncheck/undo/redo/save/open - verify
 * Test performance/correctness with large DB's, such as 3000+ entries
 * Make sure that everything that impacts the DB can be undone/redone
 * Change computer date to test reconcile/year-end, running in a VM
 * Thoroughly test all variations of ScheduledEvent, changing dates in a VM
 * Test various screen resolutions, themes, and font scales (i.e. 100%, 150%)
 * Test keyboard entry, tab-to-controls, non-mouse usage
 * Modify aged SchEvent, is repeat-count updated correctly? All 5 modes?
 * Test all ops (delete, edit, splits) on last and first entry of checkbook
 * Check logs after each run to see if there were any stealthy problems
Basic Functionality Test Script...
 Note that this script should be improved by running it in a VM with
 the OS set to prescribed dates in order to evaluate both reconciling
 and year-end wrap-up in a realistic manner. Until then, just use suc-
 ceeding dates for each step below. Note that this tests reconciliation
 anomalies, not the happy-path, so it appears to make very little sense.
 (The $8 pmt never clears; the $50 pmt isn't reflected in closing bal.)
 Note: In competing apps the sign of the disparity might be reversed.
